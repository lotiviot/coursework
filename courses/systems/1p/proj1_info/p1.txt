turnin code:  cs_p1


Write a C program that can accept either 1 or 2 command-line args.

If there is just 1 argument and it is
    -hw
you should simply print
    hello world
and then exit(0).

Otherwise the program should receive 2 command-line args, both of which
are file names.

The program should perform a byte-by-byte comparison of the 2 files.
Stop the comparison at the first byte-location in which the 2 files differ
and print:
    location: 0xMM 0xNN
e.g.:
    1008: 0x4F 0xA3
where 1008 is a decimal number representing the distance into the files
*(relative to 0)* at which the first difference occurs.  And, 0x4F and 0xA3
are the first two bytes in the files that differ.

If one file is shorter than the other, print EOF as the value for that file.
The location in that case would be one byte distance beyond the last byte
actually in the file, e.g.:
    103: 0xE3 EOF

If the files are identical, print the word SAME without a location, e.g.:
    SAME


TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir:
	tar cvf p1.tar ./p1dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    After un-tarring the project, I will cd to the dir containing it and type:
        rm -rf p1
        rm -f *.o
        make
    It should build an executable named p1.
    Sample un-tar, build, and simple execution will be provided in a script
    in p1testfiles/PREP.py which must execute correctly for the project to
    be graded further.
