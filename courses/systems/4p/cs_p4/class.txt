                                 Fall 2019


turnin code:  cs_p4


Write a program that forks one process.  Have the new process execve the
program named /usr/bin/sort.  Use dup/dup2 and a pipe to establish a way
for the original process to pass stdin to sort.  The sort program will
simply print to stdout.


Be sure to have this as the first executable line in *BOTH* processes:

    alarm(60)


Be sure to pass LC_ALL with value  C  for sort's environment:

    LC_ALL   C    // sort "traditional" way

(en_US.UTF-8 would sort same as cmd-line, which we do NOT want.)


The original process should read lines of input from a file named as the
first command-line arg.  Discard any lines that contain the word foobar
in lower-case.  All other lines should be passed to sort via the pipe.

Command-line args after the filename should be handed to sort as if they
were entered on its command-line; there will not be more than 3.

I will run tests by typing commands like this:

    ./p4 infilename1
    ./p4 infilename2 -n     # -n will be passed as arg to sort
    ./p4 infilename2 -n -r  # -n and -r will be passed as args to sort


As in prior projects, if the program is run with a single command-line arg
of  -hw  then it should simply  print hello world   and then  exit(0)


TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir named p4dir:
	tar cvf p4.tar ./p4dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    After un-tarring your project, I will cd to the dir containing
    it and type:
        rm -rf p4
        rm -f *.o
        make
    It should build an executable named p4 as described above.
    Sample un-tar, build, and simple execution will be provided in the script
    p4testfiles/PREP.py which must execute correctly to be graded further.
