d08 should be run via the pyserver to make sure files can be loaded;
    may need to copy threeJS to here for pyserver to see it and alter
    d08.html to look here for it
    OR better idea, create  link   ln -s ../threeJS

d09 requires:
    ColladaLoader.js from ../threeJS/*  ## to load the model
    police.dae from ../content          ## the model to load
    SFERIFF.JPG                         ## a texture for the model
    SFERIFFI.JPG                        ## a texture for the model

    - used to cause an error to print on the console, but I commented
      out a line that invoked mygame.create since it could (probably would)
      be invoked from two places
    - NOTE that if you maneuver the car to hit the green sphere which is
    placed randomly in the scene, the green sphere moves to a new spot.
    NOTE also, that the car bumps off the walls.
