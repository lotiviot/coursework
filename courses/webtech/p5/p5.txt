                                   Project 5


turnin code:  awt_p5


Provide a single web page that has a radio button at the top with 2 options.
The first option should be for 2D and the second for 3D.  There should
also be 2 "number" values which ranges between 400 and 900, inclusive, in
increments of 100, with default value of 500.  The first of these 2 values
is to provide the size of a square canvas.  The second is to provide the
number of dots to be painted at random locations inside the square/cube.
All 3 items should have an associated label to make their purpose clear.
There should also be a button at the top labeled "Run!".  When pressed,
it should cause all the graphic items to be drawn onto the canvas.  If 3D,
the graphic items should be rotatable, as in the class demo.

The areas inside and outside the circle/sphere should be different colors.
Also, the color for the dots should differ from those used for the
square/cube and circle/sphere.  Also, the dots inside the circle/sphere
should be a different color from those outside the circle/sphere.  Any dart
on the circle/sphere should be counted as inside.

Hint about radio buttons:
    a list of radio buttons can be examined to determine which has true for
    the attribute "checked"
Hints about the 3D:
1.  visible edges on a cube:
        https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/EdgesGeometry
2.  transparent cube:
        transparent and opacity options on MeshBasicMaterial
3.  pivot as parent of dots (instead of scene);
        pivot can rotate when mouse moves:  pivot = new THREE.Object3D();


Use turnin to submit a tar file containing all files for the project.

p5 will be graded in one of two ways (like p1):

    1. use p5.html as an argument to google chrome on the cmd-line
         #### note we now require p5.html instead of p1.html ####

    2. python3 -m http.server --cgi 5994 &
        ## where 5994 is a port that may change; I will choose the port
        ##   number AT THE TIME OF TESTING

    in chrome on another computer, visit:
        http://www.cs.mtsu.edu:5994    ## 5994 chgd to same port as above

    When I visit that URL, there should be a file there named p5.html
    which I will select to load into the browser.
