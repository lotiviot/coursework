WebSockets are not similar to HTTP. They are normal sockets with some
framing and an HTTP-compatible handshake. The HTTP-compatible handshake is
just to allow WebSocket connection on the same port that a webserver is
running on (so the webserver can forward them), but once the connection is
established, the webserver is not in the loop. WebSockets is not limited to
browser clients. See libwebsocket which has both a non-browser client and a
server.

WebSockets don't make AJAX obsolete but they do supersede Comet (HTTP
Long-polling/HTTP Streaming) as the solution of choice for true realtime
functionality. AJAX should still be used for making short-lived web service
calls.  WebSockets should now be the go-to standard for realtime
functionality since they offer low latency bi-directional communication over
a single connection.

Maximize the validation on both client and server side against the received
input. Client and server basically should not trust each other by default.

Maximize the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption to achieve integrity.

Carefully implement authentication and session management between endpoints.
