                                   Project 1


turnin code:  awt_p1


This project will use html5 and css3 (with media queries);
it will NOT use javascript.

Create a responsive web page using the grid and/or flexbox models.
It should operate as the demo shown in class, i.e. support three
configurations based on page size:
        - 750px
        750px +
        1000px +

There are 3 *.png files in the public directory that show basic layout
at each size.  Configuration should handle both arrangement inside the
bordered container, as well as relative sizes of the components, as in
the demo.


Use turnin to submit a tar file containing all files for the project.

p1 will be graded in one of two ways:

    1. use p1.html as an argument to google chrome on the cmd-line

    2. on www.cs.mtsu.edu in this manner:
        python3.8  -m http.server  --cgi  5994 &
            ## where 5994 is a port that may change; I will choose the
            ##   port number AT THE TIME OF TESTING

        in google chrome on another computer, visit:
            http://www.cs.mtsu.edu:5994    ## 5994 chgd to same port

        When I visit that URL, there should be a file there named
        p1.html which I will select to load into the browser.
