                                   Project 2


turnin code:  awt_p2


This project will use javascript in addition to html5 and css3.

We will build one version of a single-page application (SPA).
In our version of SPA, we will NOT keep track of "fake" URLs onto the page.
Instead, we build an interactive application that resides on a single page.
The project should present an interface similar to that demonstrated
in class for the PlayCanvas Editor.  The pc*.png files show the type of
layout that you need to provide, including situations in which various
parts of the interface have been collapsed.  However, you do NOT need to
provide all the machinery available on PlayCanvas.  Your version can be
simple colored, collapsible sections like shown in the demo*.png files
from the class demo.  Also, you do NOT need to provide the drop-down menu.
As in the demo, the application should remain totally on the page when
resizing down to some reasonable minimum.

As usual, grid and flexbox are OK; float and clear should be avoided.

You may use the collapse_btn.png and menu_btn*.png files in your project.


Use turnin to submit a tar file containing all files for the project.

p2 will be graded in one of two ways (like p1):

    1. use p2.html as an argument to google chrome on the cmd-line
         #### note we now require p2.html instead of p1.html ####

    2. python3 -m http.server --cgi 5994 &
        ## where 5994 is a port that may change; I will choose the port
        ##   number AT THE TIME OF TESTING

    in chrome on another computer, visit:
        http://www.cs.mtsu.edu:5994    ## 5994 chgd to same port as above

    When I visit that URL, there should be a file there named p2.html
    which I will select to load into the browser.
